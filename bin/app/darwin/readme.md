# Mac OS

You can find the binary version for macOS [here](https://github.com/UNamurCSFaculty/2122_INFOB318_ESLintME/releases/tag/release). If the file size exceeds 100MB, github prevents the upload of the file.

This version is the universal version of the app.
That means the app can run on both intel and arm architectures.
