\section{Build}
This software requires Node.js. It was tested using node v12.8.2 and v16.4.0. 
Using a newer version of node should not be an issue. 
However, the use of an older version could potentially cause some issues 
(also, keep in mind that node v12.x and lower won't be supported after April 2022). 
\subsection{Website}
\subsection{App}

In order to build the app, you must head to the 
\verb|/src/eslintme-website| directory.

On unix like systems, you can run \verb|npm run export-to-electron|. 
This command will import the static build of the website in the app directory.

On Windows, the process will need a few more steps.
