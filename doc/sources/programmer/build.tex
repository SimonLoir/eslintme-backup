\section{Build}
This software needs nodejs v12.8.2 in order to be built. 
\subsection{Website}
\subsection{App}

In order to build the app, you must head to the 
\verb|/src/eslintme-website| directory.

On unix like systems, you can run \verb|npm run export-to-electron|. 
This command will import the static build of the website in the app directory.

On Windows, the process will need a few more steps.
