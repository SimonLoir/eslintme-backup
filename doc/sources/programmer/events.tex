\section{Events}
Events are used to transfer information between the different parts of the software.
The custom events used in this app are always structured in the same way. Events are represented as an object. This object always contains a property "type" that specifies the type of the event. 
\subsection{Window Events}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{select-dirs} is an event emitted by the file manager. This event tells the Electron wrapper to show a dialog prompting the user to choose a directory.
    \item \texttt{process-finished} is an event emitted by the file manager. This event tells the progress bar that all the files were processed and therefore the rotating wheel should be hidden.
    \item \texttt{new-file-processing} is an event emitted by the file manager. This event tells the progress bar that a new file was added to the queue and the progress bar should indicate that the app is processing the file.
\end{itemize}
